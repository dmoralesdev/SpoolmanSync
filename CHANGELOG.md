## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Multi-spool label sheet printing** — Select multiple spools and print QR labels on standard label sheets (e.g., Avery 8160). Configurable paper size, grid layout, margins, spacing, borders, and label content

### Fixed
- Incorrect filament usage for long prints crossing Monday midnight — utility meter was configured with `cycle: weekly`, causing HA to reset accumulated weight automatically (#19)
- False RFID mismatch warnings on non-Bambu (third-party) spools without RFID tags (#15)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Configurable direct access port for the HA add-on — change in the add-on Configuration tab to avoid port 3000 conflicts with other add-ons (#14)

### Fixed
- QR code and NFC tag URLs now use the configured port instead of hardcoded 3000
- Removed confusing duplicate Network port section from add-on Configuration UI

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Home Assistant add-on** - Install directly from the HA add-on store with ingress sidebar integration; auto-discovers printers from ha-bambulab
- **QR code label generation** - Create and print QR code labels for spools; scan with phone camera to assign to AMS trays
- **NFC tag writing** - Write spool URLs to NFC sticker tags for tap-to-assign on Android devices
- **Dynamic spool assignment page** - QR scans and NFC taps redirect to a dedicated assignment page with tray selection
- **AMS 2 Pro and AMS HT support** - Entity pattern matching for newer AMS hardware variants
- **Auto-recovery for broken HA connections** - Embedded mode silently re-authenticates when tokens are invalidated; shows reconnect form if password was changed (#10)
- **Unraid Community Apps template** - XML template and icon for Unraid CA store

### Fixed
- External spool active tray detection for printers without AMS (#11)
- Crash when assigned spool has missing filament color or material data (#12)
- AMS discovery for entities with renamed or missing printer prefix
